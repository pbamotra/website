Hi there, welcome to my digital garden.

These are my ever evolving notes. I write these notes to organize my thoughts around different topics and to connect dots between ideas. These notes reflect my own understanding and has been shared publicly because it might help you discover even more connections.

I generally like to write about books I'm reading, poetry, [shayari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urdu_poetry), and my mental models.

This garden is a living being so choose your own adventure. Write to me or follow me on [twitter].
