Hi there, welcome to my digital garden.

This is my attempt at building a personal wiki or exobrain.

I generally like to write about programming or rust things, but recently I've started writing more about tools for thought.

My garden hasn't been tended very well - but I'm working on that. Check back in later or follow me on [twitter] to stay up to date.
