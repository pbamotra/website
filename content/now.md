During my work hours I'm building [AutoCAD]'s assitive ML [solutions](https://help.autodesk.com/view/ACD/2023/ENU/?guid=GUID-64CFD65E-ABD0-49A8-9218-D4E2D22BC070)

In my spare time I'm connecting the dots between ideas in my [digital garden].

Check out my [projects page](./projects.md) for links to things I've worked on in the past.

This page is inspired by the ["now page" movement](https://nownownow.com/about).
