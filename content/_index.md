## Hello, Bennett here.

I’m a Software Developer living in Brisbane, working on making cool things
in the browser at [Clipchamp.](https://clipchamp.com)

When I'm not at work, you'll find me ricing Archlinux, evangelizing Vim and spending hours and hours fighting the borrow-checker in Rust.

If you'd like to get in contact, you can send me an email at: `me at bennetthardwick.com`
