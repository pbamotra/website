During my work hours I'm building [Clipchamp] - a video editor that works entirely in the browser.
Rather than working on product code, I'm working on building tools and abstractions to make other devs at Clipchamp's life easier and safer.

In my spare time I'm tending my [digital garden] and working on a secret Roam Research inspired tool for thought.

On the weekends I've been getting more and more into garden and I'm trying to build some raised garden beds without spending any money (a lot harder than it sounds.)

Check out my [projects page](./projects) for links to things I've worked on in the past.

This page is inspired by the ["now page" movement](https://nownownow.com/about).
